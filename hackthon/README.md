## 📖 Introduction
**JanRakshak AI** is a hyper-resilient, offline-first medical intelligence platform designed specifically for **India's 1.2 Million ASHA workers**. It brings clinical-grade AI diagnostics and risk scoring to a ₹6,000 smartphone, ensuring that the **600 Million rural citizens** living in "Dark Zones" (no internet) are never more than a few clicks away from a life-saving diagnosis.

---

## 🔴 The Problem Statement
Rural India faces a three-fold healthcare crisis:
1.  **Late Detection:** 1.4 Million preventable deaths annually due to delayed diagnosis.
2.  **Analog Bottleneck:** 95% of ASHA workers still use paper registers with no way to calculate health risks.
3.  **Connectivity Gap:** Existing healthcare apps rely on "The Cloud," making them useless in villages with zero signal.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
We have built a **"Pocket PHC"** (Primary Health Centre) that decentralizes intelligence:
- **AI-Powered Prediction:** Instead of just recording data, we use **Gemini 1.5 Flash** and custom clinical logic to **Predict** risks for Heart, Diabetes, and Pregnancy.
- **Hyper-Resiliency:** 100% of the risk-scoring works **Offline**. If the internet fails, the app uses an **SMS Fallback Bridge** to alert doctors.
- **Literacy-Ready:** Multilingual AI voice feedback in **Hindi, Telugu, and English** bridges the divide for non-literate patients.
